<h1>About Me</h1>
<h3>Hi, My name is Subrata Kundu</h3>
<p>I have worked on a variety of projects, from frontend to backend projects. I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow as a developer. I am persuing my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering from Future Institute of Technology Under MAKAUT University, Kolkata,West Bengal(India). I have a keen interest in backend development technologies like NodeJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB. I am also interested in frontend technologies like ReactJS, NextJS, and SvelteKit. As a full stack developer, I understand that a website is more than just a collection of web pages - it is also a tool that enables a business to accomplish its goals. Therefore, my approach to web development is focused on developing a website that is intuitive, attractive, and easy to use. I am also learning full stack development. I am applying what I have learned from the courses to my everyday work.</p>
